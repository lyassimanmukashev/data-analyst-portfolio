#### About
Hey everyone! I'm Lyassiman, and I'm putting together my first portfolio. It's a whole new thing for me, and I'm really excited about it. I'm a third-year student and currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in **Business Administration** with a major in **Financial Risk Management**, so I've got a solid financial background.  To enhance my knowledge and skills, I have completed **Google Data Analytics Certificate** to delve deeper into data and gain proficiency in technical skills, opening up new opportunities in the data field, which complements my main direction in the Financial Sector. 

Throughout my studies, I focus on real-life scenarios, cases, projects, and other activities that help me refine and enhance my financial skills. It always feels good to find and identify various patterns in databases and financial markets, such as stocks or bonds. It sharpens my critical and analytical mindset. I consistently use online courses, mainly from Coursera, to enhance my analytical skills and apply them to my case studies and real-life situations. These courses provide me with valuable experience in data analysis, data management, data processing, visualization, forecasting, and other financial skills.

During my free time, I like to stay updated on finance news and often analyze open data sources to discover new information and gain insights to answer my personal questions. In this portfolio, I will include my case studies and projects to demonstrate my experience and skills in Data/Finance Analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will describe my projects and briefly describe the case, goals, skills that I used to solve it, tools, and results.

### Case Study 1. Analyze the difference between Cyclistic's Annual Members and Casual Riders
- ([CaseStudy1.pdf](https://github.com/lyassimanmukashev/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/CaseStudy1.pdf))

**Code:** ([SQL](https://github.com/lyassimanmukashev/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/CasualAnnual.sql))

**Goal:** Identify the differences between Casual Riders and Annual Members

**Description:** The project is focused on analyzing riders' data over several months. The data is obtained from Divvy Bikes datasets, which are public data licensed by Lyft Inc. You can find the data at [https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html]. For this project, I utilized data from November 2023 through April 2024. The dataset includes rider IDs, start times, end times, types of membership (Casual Riders, Annual Members), and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, conducting exploratory data analysis, and analyzing the differences between Annual Members and Casual Riders. The aim was to uncover trends and insights that could aid the marketing team in making better decisions for the company.

**Skills:** Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization

**Tools:** SQL, Tableau, Google Sheets, Google Slides

**Results/Conclusion:** Using SQL, the analysis indicates a significant disparity between both types of riders. Through insights and trends, the marketing team can implement strategies to convert riders into annual members.
